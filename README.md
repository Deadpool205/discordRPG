# discordRPG v0.1
RPG for Discord.

This project is essentially supposed to create a text-based MMORPG-style game (specifically taking inspiration from aspects of Runescape), playable by any and all.

# Current Features:

*Skills*: Mining, Woodcutting, and Fighting! All of these three give experience, and have skill levels calculated.

*Shops*: Buy, value, and sell items! The wares available are dependant on rank, but not randomized yet.

*Inventory Management*: You can equip items, unequip items, and manage your inventory.

#Project Goal:
To create a bot which works as an MMORPG host for Discord, and make it easy to fork and customize to your liking both through code and Discord commands!
