RPG for Discord.

This project is essentially supposed to create a text-based MMORPG-style game (specifically taking inspiration from aspects of Runescape), playable by any and all.

# Current Features:

Separately managed user data, with monster fights and very, very basic loot tables which make no difference as of yet.
