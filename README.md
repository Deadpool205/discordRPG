# discordRPG v0.1
RPG for Discord.

This project is essentially supposed to create a text-based MMORPG-style game (specifically taking inspiration from aspects of Runescape), playable by any and all.

# Current Features:

*Skills*: Mining, Woodcutting, and Fighting! All of these three give experience, and have skill levels calculated.

*Shops*: Buy, value, and sell items! The wares available are dependant on rank, but not randomized yet.

*Inventory Management*: You can equip items, unequip items, and manage your inventory.

*Weather*: Ambient weather that dynamically affects the world around you, in ways including speeding up the growth of trees during rain!

*Trading*: Trade with other players! Floating trading inventory keeps track of both players' items, and counts the value for you! Once one player has confirmed, you're protected by the other player losing the ability to add or remove items from the trade!

#Project Goal:
To create a bot which works as an MMORPG host for Discord, and make it easy to fork and customize to your liking both through code and Discord commands!
